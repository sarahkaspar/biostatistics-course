# Setup

You need R and RStudio running on your computer, as we will not fix installations during the course.  

Links for installation:
R (install this first): https://cloud.r-project.org/
RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

If you have an EMBL account, an alternative to installation can be using rstudio.embl.de - please check that you can log in, in case you want to use this option. 

To install all packages necessary for completing the exercises and running the demonstrations, run the following command from the console in RStudio:

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("https://www.huber.embl.de/users/kaspar/biostat_2021/install_packages_biostat.R")
```
