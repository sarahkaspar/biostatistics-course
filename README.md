# Lesson on statistical distributions in R for biologists


This lesson on categorical data can be taught in ~2 hours. 
I'm using the [carpentries workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/) for creating these online materials. 
The materials are meant  
- for self-learning
- to be used by other trainers
- to document the R-code for the figues

In practice, I use slides for teaching. 

Have a look at the [compiled materials](sarahkaspar.github.io/categorical-data).
