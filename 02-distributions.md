::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Which of the following statements are true?  



1. A probability distribution assigns probabilities to possible outcomes of an experiment.  
2. The probabilities in a statistical distribution sum/integrate up to 1.  
3. If the experiments are not randomized, the results don't follow a statistical distribution.  


:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Solution
 
Answers 1 and 2 are correct. To 3: If experiments are not randomized, the results still follow some distribution, but they are likely to not represent reality well.

## Challenge 2: Discrete distributions

What is the probability of an outcome of X=1.5 in a discrete distribution?

- 0 
- 0.5 
- 0.15 

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

The value $1.5$ is not discrete, and can therefore not occur in a discrete distribution. Its probability is zero.
