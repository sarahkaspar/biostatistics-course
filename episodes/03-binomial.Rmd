- Explain how the binomial distribution describes outcomes of counting.

The binomial distribution is what we have just seen in the example: We use it when we have a fixed sample size and count the number of "successes" in that sample. Examples are:

- how many locations in the genome carry a mutation
- the number of cells within a sample that show a certain phenotype
- how many patients out of 100 have a certain disease
- how many out of 10 frogs are light green

The binomial model has two parameters, which means the probabilities for the individual outcomes depend on two things: 
- $n$ is the number of trials, or frogs, or patients, and itâ€™s fixed.
- $p$ is the success probability.

Then the probability of observing $k$ successes out of $n$ draws (for example $k=4$ light coloured frogs out of $N=10$) can be described by this formula:

$$P(X=k) = {n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^k$$

You don't have to remember this piece of math -- it's just to make the point that you can calculate the probability of an event that is modeled with the binomial distribution, if you know the success probability $p$ and the number of trials $n$, i.e. the parameters.


::::::::::::::::::: callout
In the binomial we just define a particular outcome as success, for example a light-coloured frog, or a patient with disease, even though that may not be a favourable outcome.

Here is what the distribution looks like for a success probability of 0.3 and a sample size of 10.

The expected value of the binomial is $n \times p$, which is quite intuitive: If we catch 10 frogs and the probability of being light-green is 0.3, then we expect to catch 3 light-green frogs on average.
