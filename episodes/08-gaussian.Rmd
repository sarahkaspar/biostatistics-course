## The Gaussian distribution

We covered the Gaussian -- also known as *Normal distribution* earlier in this tutorial as an example, and you have most likely come across it before.  

It is applicable to repeated measurements of the same thing, for example  

- frog lengths,  
- temperatures or  
- pixel intensities.

The Gaussian distribution is continuous and has two parameters:  

- the *mean*, which is estimated by the sample mean, and  
- the *variance*, which is estimated by the sample variance.
